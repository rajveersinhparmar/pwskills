    "Ans:The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) together into a single unit called a class. It allows the data to be hidden and accessed only through the defined methods, providing control over data access and modification. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and maintaining the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class called a parent or base class. The class that inherits the properties is called a child or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, allowing different implementations based on the specific context of each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within a program. It focuses on the essential features of an object or system, hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define a set of common properties and behaviors for subclasses to implement. It helps in managing complexity and facilitates code modularization and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP provide a foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. They help in organizing code, managing dependencies, and modeling real-world entities effectively."

    "In this example, the Car class has an __init__() method defined with three parameters: brand, model, and color. These parameters represent the initial attributes of a car object. Inside the __init__() method, the values of these parameters are assigned to the corresponding instance variables (self.brand, self.model, and self.color).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create objects of the Car class, like my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", \"Silver\"), the __init__() method is automatically called, and the values provided during object creation are passed as arguments to the method. The __init__() method then initializes the object's attributes based on these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() method allows us to set the initial state of an object and provide values for its attributes at the time of object creation. It ensures that every object of the class starts with the specified attributes in a consistent state. Without the __init__() method, we would need to manually set the attributes of each object after creation, which could lead to errors and make the code less readable and maintainable.\n",
